CALVINS TUTORIAL to get app running on yalls laptop/phone:
This is the BLE github:https://github.com/dotintent/react-native-ble-plx/blob/master/README.md
Using this is why we need a Dev build

1) npm install
2) Install bluetooth package | npm (or npx?) install react-native-ble-plx | more info on the gitub linked above
3) Switch to development build | npx expo install expo-dev-client
(I ran this at some point in troubleshooting connection, but I dont use an eas build so I would wait to use this unless errors come up (npm install -g eas-cli))
4) To see if this runs without a physical device, try npx expo run:ios
5) To run on physical device, start with npx expo prebuild | follow this tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0gdh418OCQ

# Welcome to your Expo app ğŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
